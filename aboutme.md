My name is Anh Le, and I am a System Engineer.
Born in 1990, I reside in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.
I am deeply passionate about network infrastructure, enterprise IT services, virtualization, cloud computing, web application development, and more.
This blog is a curated space where I share my random thoughts on life and delve into technical articles that reflect my personal interests.
